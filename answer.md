The author shares several points about computers:

1. **Early Interactivity**: The author mentions an early desire for a desk that could respond to keystrokes in real-time, unlike punch card systems.
2. **First Exposure**: One of the author's friends built a microcomputer from a Heathkit, which impressed the author.
3. **Personal Experience**: The author convinced his father to buy a TRS-80 computer around 1980, which was used for programming simple games, predicting model rocket flight, and creating a word processor.
4. **Comparing to Apple II**: The author notes that while the Apple II was the gold standard, the TRS-80 was sufficient for their needs.
5. **Interest in AI**: The author was inspired by a novel featuring an intelligent computer and a PBS documentary showing Terry Winograd using SHRDLU, leading to a switch from philosophy to studying AI.
6. **Transition in Technology**: The author went straight from batch processing to microcomputers, finding microcomputers particularly exciting due to their interactivity.
7. **Impact of Moore's Law**: The author mentions Interleaf, a company that was crushed by the exponential growth in the power of commodity processors in the 1990s.

These points highlight the author's early fascination with computers and the evolving landscape of technology during their formative years.
